# Date Picker Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev    # For npm users
yarn dev       # For yarn users
pnpm dev       # For pnpm users
bun dev        # For bun users
```
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.

### Editing Pages
You can start editing the main page by modifying `pages/index.js`. Changes will auto-update as you edit the file.

### API Routes
Next.js API routes can be accessed via http://localhost:3000/api/hello.

This endpoint is located in `pages/api/hello.js`. All files within the `pages/api` directory are mapped to `/api/*` and treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

### Font Optimization
This project uses [next/font](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
